Later on, he performed three pilgrimages of India, barefoot giving discourses on Bhagavad Gita at 84 places. These 84 places are known as Pushtimarg Baithak and since then are the places of pilgrimage. Yet, he stayed in Vrindavan for four months each year.

The forest cover has been whittled away to only a few remaining spots, and the local wildlife, including peacocks, cows, monkeys and a variety of bird species has been virtually eliminated.', '2022-09-20 14:35:01'),

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in other popular programming languages.[1]\r\nPython is a multi-paradigm programming language, that is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. Many of the capabilities that the Python language supports are object-oriented programming and functional programming. This language follows a philosophy, which consists of phrases such as:\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful is better than ugly\"\r\n\"Simple is better than Complex\"\r\n\"Readability counts\"\r\n\"Explicit is better than implicit\"\r\n\"Complex is better than complicated\"\r\nSee Zen of Python for more information about this philosophy.\r\n\r\nPython aims for simplicity and a less-cluttered syntax, while allowing developers to have options for their preferred coding method. Python has many versions out for developers to use. This consists of Python 2 (now on Sunset Status) and Python 3.9 (October 2020).\r\nPython is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Python supports many programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, simplicity, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in other popular programming languages. Python is very extensible and the modularity of this language has made it popular for adding interfaces to existing applications.[1]\r\n\r\nThis course comprises 16 lessons on Python programming using Python 3. Each lesson includes a combination of Wikipedia and Internet-based readings, YouTube videos, and hands-on learning activities.\r\n\r\nThis entire Wikiversity course can be downloaded in book form by selecting Download Learning Guide in the sidebar.', '2022-09-21 07:55:13');
